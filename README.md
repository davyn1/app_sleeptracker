Features work fine. The notification is hard to test due to the set times it will go off. 


--Aim for no more than two sentences for each of the following questions.--


6. Did you design your app with a particular type of user in mind? If so, whom?
Yes I did, Myself and an average 8-5 working slave. 


7. Did you design your app specifically for iOS or Android, or both?
Android


8. How can a person log overnight sleep in your app? Why did you choose to support logging overnight sleep in this way?
They can go into the overnight log tab and click the addition button. The plus button also represents usability in the way that is easy to learn and 
if easy to remember how to use proficiently. 


9. How can a person log sleepiness during the day in your app? Why did you choose to support logging sleepiness in this way?
Similar to the overnight log, but on the sleepiness log tab. The plus button also represents usability in the way that is easy to learn and 
if easy to remember how to use proficiently. 


10. How can a person view the data they logged in your app? Why did you choose to support viewing logged data in this way?
The data that is added by a user will be displayed


11. Which feature choose--using a native device resource, backing up logged data, or both?
I did a native device resource. 


12. If you used a native device resource, what feature did you add? How does this feature change the app's experience for a user?
I added a notification to remind users when to log their sleepiness. It would remind them during a busy day to track their sleepiness. 
The notifications are set to go off at 12PM, 4PM and 8PM. I selected these times because its during the work day and right after the work day ends. 


13. If you backed up logged data, where does it back up to?
N/A

14. How does your app implement or follow principles of good mobile design?
My initial view is straight forward and is self explanatory. There are ways to back out of actions that are accidentally pressed. There are also 
error prevention methods such as if someone were to try and log their sleep but selected and end sleeptime before their start sleeptime.
